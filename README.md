## ‚úçÔ∏è Usage Examples

### Abstract
```latex
pcsabstract
{THESIS TITLE}
{STUDENT NAME}
{2025}
{ADVISOR NAME, DEGREE, TITLE, DEPARTMENT}
{ABSTRACT TEXT (‚â§150 words).}
```

### Title Page with Committee
The command `\thesistitlepage` now takes **6 arguments**:

```latex
	hesistitlepage
{THESIS TITLE}           % 1. Title
{STUDENT NAME}           % 2. Author
{YEAR}                   % 3. Year
{COMMITTEE MEMBER 1}     % 4. Chair
{COMMITTEE MEMBER 2}     % 5. Member
{COMMITTEE MEMBER 3}     % 6. Member
```

Example:
```latex
	hesistitlepage
{A STUDY OF SIMULATED WIND TUNNEL DATA}
{JANE DOE}
{2025}
{PROF. SAM SMITH}
{DR. LINDA JONES}
{DR. ROBERT TAYLOR}
```

This produces the author‚Äôs name at the top, the standard submission wording, and three aligned signature lines for approval.

### Citations
Add references to `references.bib`:
```bibtex
@article{einstein1905,
  author  = {Albert Einstein},
  title   = {Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?},
  journal = {Annalen der Physik},
  year    = {1905},
  volume  = {18},
  pages   = {639--641}
}
```
Then cite in text:
```latex
As shown in \cite{einstein1905}, energy and mass are equivalent.
```

### Tables
```latex
\cnuTable{Experimental Results}{
egin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
A & B \\
\hline
1 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}
```

### Figures
```latex
\cnuFigure{Sample Plot}{
\includegraphics[width=0.6	extwidth]{example-image}
}
```
